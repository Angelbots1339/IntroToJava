# Intro to Java
Taught by: Justin Nesselrotte

## Goals
The main goal of this course is to teach the Angelbotics FRC team Java well enough that they can use it to program a robot. However, we will primarily focus on learning Java in the context of being able to use it on any project.

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites to this class.

## Core Tenants
I have a few rules that will be upheld above all others. You have my permission to call me on it if I violate one as well.

1. Never make fun of a student, especially not when they're trying to learn. If you feel someone asked a dumb question because you already know the answer, don't say anything mean. That also means you should feel safe asking questions at all times.
2. Do not cheat. Ever. I'm likely to dismiss you from the class if I find out. I'd rather you miss an assignment than to have you cheat.
3. Mutual respect. If you do not feel respected, you will not participate, speak up, ask for help, or continue with the course. It is of utmost importance that I show you respect. Please return it in kind by showing up ready to learn.


# Course structure
This list may be incomplete. As the course goes on, I may find new ways to teach you. This class will not earn any course credits, but the good news is that the grading is also made up. Please have patience while we figure some of these things out together.

## Lessons
In person lessons taught in the Butler building, currently on Tuesdays after school. These will focus on concepts needed to complete the assignments and expand your knowledge of programming concepts. 

Attendance will be taken, but that is not the only deciding factor for success. If you cannot make it on Tuesdays, but can do the other assignments, just let me know in Discord or if we see each other in person. I'll see what I can do in those situations if it's only a few students.

## Assignments / Projects
The assignments will be like your homework. The assignments are designed for an individual to complete them. Working through them is one of the best ways to increase your ability to program. They are not one to one with the lessons. I may assign multiple assignments at the end of a lesson.

Ideally, the assignment is completed in time for me to leave notes on your code in GitHub. If I am at the Butler, you may ask for help with your assignment, clarification, etc. See the "where can I get help" section below.

Sometimes we will also do projects. These are more open-ended than assignments and are more likely to be group projects.

## Quizzes
Sometimes I'll want to quickly review things in the form of a quiz. These will usually be very short and graded on the spot. Ideally, they'll give me more information about anything that should be covered more thoroughly or again.

## Final Exam
Your final exam will consist of *redacted*, and will hopefully serve as a recap of your progress so far. Note that the final exam is redacted because I haven't settled on what your final exam will be, not because it's a secret. But as soon as I figure it out... well I still might keep it a secret.

# Frequently Asked Questions
## Can I learn how to program?
Yes. I've never met a student who could not learn to program, I have met many bad programming teachers. One thing to always remember, especially when you're doubting yourself, is that telling yourself you cannot do something automatically means you can't.

The reality is at some point during this course, you will struggle to understand something. That's perfectly okay, it's part of the learning process. It isn't embarrassing or a commentary about your worth as a person. It's a road block that will one day look like a small pebble, and you'll wonder how you ever tripped on it in the first place.

## Where can I get help?
You can get help from me, your teacher. You may also post in the #programming-lessons discord channel.

You may also ask your peers for help, with two important caveats. The first is that you MAY NOT copy what your peer has written verbatim. The second is that your peer may also not know the answer. It's okay if that happens, maybe you can then figure it out together.

Some sites, like StackOverflow may have answers that are useful to you while learning. Keep in mind that the poster of that code may be just as lost as you are. You may NOT copy code directly from StackOverflow. Understand it, close the tab, then write it yourself.

Where you may NOT get help from is any AI based solution. I know it's awesome new technology that's super exciting, however it goes against the goals of this course.

## Is Java the best/easiest/most fun programming language to learn?
Ehhhhh, okay so lots of people have lots of opinions on this subject. One day, you'll get to have opinions too! And they can be absolutely as deranged as you want! You can have opinions on languages, frameworks, operating systems, anything really! It's not exactly useless to have those opinions, but I don't really like to have them. I have preferences sure, but I have found far too many people who enjoy arguing their opinions over building stuff. I'm here to help you build stuff.

As far as Java, a programming language is just that, a language for programming. It makes some things easy and other things hard. That is true for any programming language on the planet, no exceptions. Java was originally designed at a time when portability was hard. You could not write one piece of code that worked on any computer operating system. Java sought to change that and even uses the tagline "Write Once Run Anywhere" (which isn't exactly true, but hey that's marketing for you).

Personally, I like learning languages. I find most of Java's core functionality can be taught relatively quickly to existing developers who have familiarity with another language, and it takes a little longer for completely new developers. That's because if you're brand new, you're having to learn a programming concept at the same time as how a language presents that concept.

In summary, Java is a programming language. It may fit well with your mental model, it may not, but it is absolutely learnable and that's what's important.

## What counts as cheating?
Copying code directly from another student or StackOverflow will be considered cheating. I would prefer, when working with another student, if that student helped explain the concept to you instead of showing you their code. Because I will not easily be able to tell who copied who, I will have to treat both parties as guilty of cheating.

Using an AI solution to generate code is also cheating.
