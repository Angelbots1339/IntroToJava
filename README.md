# Intro To Java

This repo is the public entry point for Angelbotics' "Intro To Java" course. We will use it for things such as common git and GitHub information, grading scripts, and pretty much any other common source of information that is okay to release or needs to be publicly accessible. More information will be published as time goes on.

# Directories
## images
Updating a GitHub wiki does not allow you to upload images directly. Instead, they have to be uploaded to an accessible location and then references via URL. While it is normally discouraged to upload binary content to a git repo, we accept the tradeoffs here to be able to use images in our Wiki. Please make sure to try and give good descriptive names to any images here.

## output
Some of our projects have an expected output or more than one expected output given a certain input. These currently are specified in the GitHub classroom autograding test itself and that's what's being graded against, but it seemed prudent to have a location to store all of those output files.

## scripts
Currently unused. Figured it would be helpful to have a common place for scripts as well.
